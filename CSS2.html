            <h2>About Me</h2> 

            <p>Hey, I’m Lone. I’m an extrovert who vibes easily with people, even though I don’t go out much. I love gaming — mainly Valorant (Omen main), CS2, The Forest, Minecraft, and my own imagination football league. I’m a huge Arsenal fan, obsessed with Harry Potter, and recently a Swiftie too.
                I care a lot about people and animals, and I just want to make others happy with whatever I create. I’m always trying to improve my English, explore new things, and work hard toward studying abroad in the UK or US. Life’s messy sometimes, but I keep going.</p>
